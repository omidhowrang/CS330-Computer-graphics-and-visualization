# CS330-Computer-graphics-and-visualization
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I have learned different design skills from the course such as creating a 3D scene, choosing the input controllers for a 3D scene and moving objects in different directions in 3D scene.
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process started with identifying the 3D scene to design from a 2D object such as an image or sketch. From, the 2D design, I decided the 3D objects to represent the different objects in the image or 2D object. After identify the 3D objects, I identified the right textures and colors for the 3D scene based on the texture of the 3D scene
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I can use the skilled gained from this project to design a 3D game, draw designs on 3D modes, or even create animations
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The development strategy i used while working on my 3D scene is using multiple light sources and mixing the light sources based on the texture of the 3D scene objects
- How did iteration factor into your development?
The iteration factor came into place while trying to come up with the most appropriate design of the 3D scene. I used and changed different things stating from shapes and texture based on the design 
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I used the agile code development technique such that I used to add new features along the way while developing the project. I did not have everything completely set up before beginning the project
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I will use the knowledge acquired from the project and the course to learn more about game development and designing project prototypes in 3D models
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I will use the knowledge acquired from the project and the course to venture into game development and virtual reality
